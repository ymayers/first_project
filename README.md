PROJECT 1 - Boredom-Bot

I plan on creating an interactive site that helps fight boredom. Too many times, you’ll hear someone(especially children) talk about how bored they are and have nothing to do.

With the Boredom-Bot, this is no longer an issue. Try or learn something new - maybe even add some items to your bucket list.

The Boredom-Bot generates activities to lull your boredom and provides resources to assist with planning them.

The activities are generated at random, using Bored API.

With one click, you’ll have an activity suggestion and tips/resources on how to go about completing that specific activity.

I plan on having a CSS robot(possibly animated) and each activity having it’s own fun themed div background.

There are 9 categories/types ["education", "recreational", "social", "diy", "charity", "cooking", "relaxation", "music", "busywork"] and price points range from free(0.0) 1.0; so, I am currently gauging how this should be conveyed to the user. I’m thinking that I should use “Free”, “Fair” and “Moderate” price points, since floats aren't user friendly.

I’d like to work on a gaining user input, through a prompt or selection menu to curtail the activities by type and price. Currently, they are just randomized to suggest a broad range of new activities.

MVP - Working button to display API data (the activities) via DOM manipulation and robot created with CSS - using flexbox.

Post MVP - User Input for activity type and price point search, animation of the robot and different div designs for each activity.
